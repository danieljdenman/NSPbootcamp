# Installation and package management

We have not yet installed a package management system, which helps us [install packages and create and maintain separate environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#) for separate programming tasks. We will now install Anaconda, do this. One of the great things about python is that we can leverage all of that public and free code out there. Great! One disadvantage: not everyone in the world has coordinated their code bases to work with everyone else's ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üñ• ü§∫ . this means that Jane's very_useful_package may require a numpy version that conflicts with Bob's pretty_good_tool. The solution: create seprate environments for working with Jane's very_useful_package and Bob's pretty_good_tool. For science, examples include separate environments for image analysis, Arduino control, a course, and a home project for scraping data from twitter. 

### Install Anaconda for package and environment management
1. [download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) Anaconda.

### Install a code editor. 
Choosing an editor is a personal choice that can generate strong opinions. [There are many options](https://hackr.io/blog/best-python-ide). If you don't already have a strong preference, we'll use a fully featured and very popular one, VS Code. [Download and install it.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Open a Terminal (Mac OS X) or the newly installed Anaconda command prompt (Windows). 
4. create a new environment. you should name your envirornment something short and informative about what it will be used for, e.g.: <br>```conda create -n NSPbootcamp```  


### Confirm you have created an Anaconda environment called NSPbootcamp
#### run the following line:
<br>```conda activate NSPbootcamp```
#### success?
you should see ```(NSPbootcamp)``` before anything else on the new line of your Terminal/shell:

<br>

### Add all of the needed packages to NSPbootcamp
There are a few different ways to add pacakges to your environment. In an Anaconda environment, choice A is to use: ```conda install name_of_my_package```. This depends on the package having an Anaconda channel. lot's of packages do. but some don't, in which case they almost certainly have a PyPi channel, in which case you need to use ```pip install name_of_my_package```.

#### here's another key element of how we'll use python: Jupyter Lab, for Jupyter ipython notebooks. let's install it: 
```conda install jupyterlab```<br>
When you install with ```conda install``` or ```pip install```, it'll have you confirm your intentions. go ahead and enter ```y``` and press ```enter```

#### we could keep going like this, one package at a time. but we can also do a bunch at once (note we could have also done this when we created the environment, but we are learning here!)
```conda install scipy seaborn scikit-image fsspec hdf5 scikit-learn statsmodels numba pytables```

### finally, let's do a pip line to install a couple of things that aren't on Anaconda: 
```conda install -c conda-forge python-igraph leidenalg```

### We should be good for the next couple of days of python fun!. 
Of course, we can always add packages later as we need them, using a terminal and ```conda install name_of_my_package```or ```pip install name_of_my_package```

### One more thing - Github Desktop.
