## Google Colab
Google colab is like a Google doc, but for a Jupyter notebook. You and a team can be working on the same notebook at the same time, and everyone can see the results. These notebooks run in on the Google Cloud Platform; basics are free. If you need more muscle or some Google Storage, you can pay. Also it doesn't hurt to ask Google, they will sometimes give you more resources than are typically free because you are doing research/non-profit work.
