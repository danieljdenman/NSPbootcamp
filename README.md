# NSP Bootcamp 2024
##  Wednesday August 21 and Thursday August 22. 
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, scripts, toy data, and other materials for the Python portion 2025 University of Colorado Neuroscience Graduate Program incoming 1st year Python coding bootcamp. The bootcamp is instructor-led, with lectures and guided and independent coding.

### Agenda
**The first part of the afternoon** is formatted to be interactive lectures; after the introductory slides, we will be running code together, with students running and writing code along with the instructor. 
<br>
**The final part of the afternoon** will be held as a looser group session. The instructor will lay out the goals with the whole group. After that, it will be independent and small group work for the duration, where each student can work at whatever level they feel comfortable with Python. We encourage you to ask lots of questions during this session - and that these questions prompt more in-depth questions, discussions, and check-in throughout the time.
