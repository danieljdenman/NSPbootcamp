Feel free to use your preferred AI tool - they all do OK. but note that the general LLMs (like ChatGPT4 or Gemini) are all prone to produce small errors in coding that can be hard to catch if you don't know what to look for. Code-specific LLMs ([Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Code LLama](https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/)) are better, but also of course still have small errors and some require subscription.
