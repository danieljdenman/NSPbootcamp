There are several platforms available for working on code collaboratively, on shared computing resources. Of course, writing, commenting, and publishing your code to public Github repositories is the most common way to collaborate, and very effective! But some use cases call for more computational power than you have avaialable locally (like on your laptop), or you may want to be able to access some code you've written from any device that has a browser (like your phone). Another use case for scientific computing: writing some code, or doing some data exploration, together in real-time. There are many ways to share code and connect to python kernels on other machines, and we won't cover most of them, but a few of the available ways are:

## Google Colab 
These notebooks are preconfigured and really good for machine learning. No install, run it in your browser. They run in on the Google Cloud Platform; basics are free. If you need more muscle or some Google Storage, you can pay. Also it doesn't hurt to ask Google, they will sometimes give you more resources than are typically free because you are doing research/non-profit work.

## [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/)
CoCalc can be used is like a Google doc, but for a Jupyter notebook. You and a team can be working on the same notebook at the same time, and everyone can see the results. CoCalc runs jupyter notebooks, as well as many other languages (R, julia, amongst others)

## [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com)
like CoCalc, Deepnote can be used is like a Google doc, but for a Jupyter notebook. You and a team can be working on the same notebook at the same time, and everyone can see the results. Deepnote also has several "integrations", which allow you to enter credentials for other services (like Github, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) to easily use code and data that is hosted somewhere else. This can ease some of the burdens of installation and configuration when setting things up on your own computer.

## Instructions for Friday afternoon:
- WFor your team, make a Google Colab notebook (from your own Google account, or sign up for a Google account with your CU credentials)
- share the link with your TA and dan. 
- go to town!
